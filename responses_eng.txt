Recently, David Wondrich found an aviation recipe in a magazine for 1911, so it is believed that the recipe was born earlier than 1916. In his book, Ensslin also indicates the type of gin used - El Bart Gin, and the recipe is made in addition to gin with lemon juice, Luxardo maraschino and violet liqueur (Creme de Violette). The recipe is found again in Harry Craddock's book («Savoy Cocktail Book», 1930), but without violet cream. This is probably due to the difficulty of finding violet cream in the post-war period of the 1960s, when it was still unavailable, and therefore, the main ingredient of the aviation cocktail was discontinued and its use was discontinued. At that moment, the bartenders finally abandoned the characteristic blue color of the drink.

There are many stories about its origin, one of which says that at the beginning of the 19th century it was customary to consume a mixture of porridge, lime, honey and garlic due to the outbreak of Spanish flu in the country. Over time, this healing drink arrived at the port of Santos, where it became known as «Caipirinha», since the main ingredient, cachaca, was usually brought from Piracicaba, in the countryside of Sao Paulo.

In addition, Hugo Ensslin no longer specified in his book how he measured the ingredients for his drinks. Thus, without knowing exactly how big the «dash» was in this case, it is difficult to determine the exact amounts of ingredients added. But this is a problem right up to the moment when we open «The Savoy Cocktail Book», published in 1930, in which Harry Craddock exactly repeated Hugo Ensslin's recipe. As you know, the «dash» in this book is already similar to the modern ideas of bartenders about the volume of this unit of measurement.

Over time, the club's membership expanded to include lawyers, bankers and well-known businessmen.

Perhaps, this category of «kill or cure» after a hangover appeared in the mid-1800s.---Created in 2019 by Mans Dahlman in Stockholm at the Papillon Bar (translated from French as «Butterfly»), the cocktail requires the use of the stir method, although at first glance an experienced bartender will say that a shake is needed here.

Named so because of the use of French blackberry and raspberry liqueur and the fact that it was served in a V-shaped glass, this «Neo-martini» does not contain vermouth and is far from being a real martini. However, during the cocktail renaissance of the late 1980s and 90s, almost any drink served in a V-shaped glass was called a «Martini», and this name stuck.

Unfortunately, there is no documentary evidence to confirm this victory or his invention of the cocktail. The recipe for a drink called «Grasshopper», consisting of equal parts of mint cream applied over cocoa cream, appears in William «Cocktail Bill» Boothby's 1908 book, where its creation is attributed to «Harry O'Brien, the late owner of the Palace Hotel in San Francisco». At some point (perhaps by Philibert Guichet of Tujague's himself), cream is added as the third ingredient to a two-component 1908 puff cocktail to make the drink we know today.

Sheridan added whiskey to hot coffee to warm up a group of American passengers disembarking from a Pan Am flying boat in Foynes on a cold and damp winter evening. They say (colon) passengers asked if they were served Brazilian coffee, to which Sheridan replied (colon)(break)<i>«This is Irish coffee»</i>.(break)Previously, aircraft did not have enough range to cross the Atlantic, and since 1937 flying boats (not to be confused with airships) were used for the flight, and the port of Foynes on the west coast of Ireland was the last refueling point for Sikorsky S-42 and Boeing 314 aircraft. The first non-stop service to New York began on June 22, 1942 and It lasted 25 hours and 40 minutes. The planes were relatively primitive, and the flight was difficult, so the invigorating strong coffee was well received by travelers tired of the cold.

There is no recipe in this source, only the name of the cocktail and the corresponding price among the other listed cocktails is 35 cents, which is twice as expensive as «Manhattan». «The Last Word»'s connection with the Detroit Athletic Club is confirmed by the notes accompanying the recipe in Ted Saucier's 1951 cocktail book, «Bottoms Up» (colon). <i>Courtesy of the Detroit Athletic Club, Detroit. This cocktail was first introduced here about thirty years ago by Frank Fogarty, who was very well known in vaudeville.

It was originally served in a V-shaped martini glass. The name of the cocktail probably comes from the English candy of the same name, called lemon drop. After its invention, the cocktail quickly spread to various places in San Francisco. In the early 1990s, the cocktail was often prepared as a chupito (for the concept of this term, it is possible to draw an analogy with limoncello, which is served by the owners of establishments as a compliment to guests (before or after a meal)) or was served in shot glasses.

The recipe of 2 parts of tequila, 1 parts of Cointreau, 1 parts of lime juice, which we know as today's «Margarita», first appears in the book by W.J.Tarling's «Cafe Royal Cocktail Book» (1937), but under the name «Picador». Tarling's 1937 recipe does not specify the brand or style of tequila, and his recipe uses lime juice or lemon, but he calls Cointreau his favorite liqueur. Cocktail historians are arguing about who added the salty rim and renamed the Picador to Margarita. The first known mention of this <i>tequila daisy / tequila sour</i> called Margarita appeared in the September 17, 1953 issue of The Press Democrat newspaper in Santa Rosa, California, in an article by Michael Demarest entitled «Memo from Mike». Having just returned from his three-week vacation, Mike talks about a meal at Ensenada, washing it down with Margaritas. The recipe was published later that year in the December 1953 issue of Esquire magazine. . (long line). <u>Who came up with such a name?</u>. - Sola Morales, a specialist in Mexican folklore, claimed that the cocktail was created in 1930Donna Bertha (Doña Bertha)</b>, owner of Bertha's bar in Taxco (Mexico);. - It is said that <b>David Daniel «Danny» Negrete</b> created this drink in 1936, when he was the manager of the Garcia Crespo Hotel in Tehuacan (Mexico). His girlfriend Margarita obviously liked the salt in her drinks, and the story goes that he created this drink for her as a gift. In 1944, Danny moved to Tijuana, Mexico, and became a bartender at the Agua Caliente racetrack, a place considered the birthplace of Margarita, in the early 1930s;. - <b>Francisco «Pancho» Morales</b> says that he created «Margarita» in the summer of 1942 while working at a bar called Tommy's Place on Juarez Avenue in Ciudad Juarez (Mexico), after <i>«4-On July 1st, 1942, a lady came in and said (colon) «Give me a Magnolia tree»»</i>. Unable to remember the recipe for the Magnolia cocktail, but remembering that it contains cointreau, lime and an alcohol base, he mixed these ingredients with tequila.
Martinez:<pre>MARTINEZ</pre>:cocktails/martinez.jpg:<b>Recipe</b>--- 4.5 cl London Dry gin;--- 4.5 cl sweet red vermouth;--- 1 bar spoon (0.5 cl) of Maraschino liqueur;--- 2 dashes of Angostura bitter Orange:<b>Method</b>--- stir (in a mixing glass):<b>Serve in a</b>. - chilled cocktail glass with no ice added:<b>Garnish</b>--- lemon zest:<em>Note--- serve with no drinking straws;--- Known as the drink that turned into Martini and then into Dry Martini, Martinez was originally based on either Dutch genever or Old Tom gin;--- IBA insists on London Dry gin</em>:Country of origin ━ 🇺🇸:Beverage historians generally agree that Martinez originated from Manhattan and preceded Martini, and that it appeared sometime in the 1860s or early 1870s. The first known cocktail recipe is contained in the book by O.H.Byron «The Modern Bartender» (1884), without specifying the exact recipe, only indicating the following (colon). «this is the same Manhattan where whiskey was replaced with gin» (also an indication of which category of gin is missing). At the same time, on the same page, just above, there are 2 recipes for different Manhattan(colon) cocktails. - <i>french vermouth (1 part), whisky (half part), angostura (3-4 dash), gum syrup (3 dash);</i>. - <i>curaçao (3 dash), Angostura (2 dash), whisky (1 part), italian vermouth (1 part)</i>. - Many bartenders consider Jerry Thomas to be the creator of Martinez, although in the book «Bar-tenders Guide» neither in the first edition of 1862, nor in the next edition of 1876, this cocktail does not appear. At the same time, its mention is published in the same book of the 3rd edition from 1887, where the recipe repeats the description of Manhattan (which, among other things, used Maraschino liqueur), except for the addition of Old Tom gin instead of rye whiskey. Hence the question (colon) who should be considered the creator of Martinez? «Purely legally» - Byron, since the name was published earlier, but the modern formulation is more similar to the Jerry Thomas variation. One thing is clear - the cocktail took centuries to get to your hands. All you have is the perfect wash without the knock of a bar spoon on the edges of a mixing glass 😃

Meanwhile, Jack Morgan, his friend and the owner of the famous British pub in Hollywood Cock'n'bull Saloon on the Sunset Strip, was trying to launch his own brand of ginger beer, but sales were not going well. Legend has it that the two men met at New York's Chatham Bar and came up with the idea to mix Martin's vodka with Morgan's ginger beer and add lime (possibly inspired by Cuba Libre) to create Moscow Mule. Others, most notably Eric Felton, in a 2007 article in The Wall Street Journal, claim that the drink was invented back in Hollywood in Cock 'n' Bull by senior bartender Wes Price. It is said that Price created this drink in an attempt to get rid of excess ginger beer in the basement of the pub. He treated actor Broderick Crawford to a new drink, and since then the drink has gained popularity. Undoubtedly, the combination of vodka and ginger beer helped Morgan and Martin to change their product range, but the success of the cocktail is largely due to the fact that it is served in a copper mug, on which a kicking mule is specially engraved. This initiative was put forward by a friend of Morgan, who recently inherited a copper factory that produced previously poorly sold copper mugs. The success of the «Moscow Mule» was extremely successful for all three friends.

Audrey Saunders worked on a cocktail recipe for a while before opening her bar in the Big Apple, and it was originally called El Cubano. It is considered the median between «Mojito» and «French 75». The key to creating this drink is the use of aged rum – hence the «old" part of its name.

Breakfast Martini:<pre>BREAKFAST MARTINI</pre>:cocktails/breakfast_martini.jpg:<b>Recipe</b>--- 5 cl London Dry gin;--- 1.5 cl citrus liqueur;--- 1.5 cl freshly squeezed lemon juice;--- 1 bar spoon of orange marmalade (jam):<b>Method</b>--- shake:<b>Serve in a</b>--- chilled cocktail glass with no ice added:<b>Garnish</b>--- twist of orange zest & orange jam chips on a clothespin:<em>Note--- serve with no drinking straws.</em>:Country of origin ━ 🇺🇸:It was created in 1996 by Salvatore Calabrese, the long-term president of the Guild of Bartenders of the United Kingdom. Being a proud Italian by birth, Salvatore usually drinks little more than a quick espresso for breakfast. However, one morning Sue, his English wife, insisted that he sit down to breakfast and served toast with jam. Salvatore came up with the idea of making a martini for breakfast while he was enjoying toast topped with hot sauce, and he took the jar with him to work. Later that day, at the London Library Bar at the Lanesborough Hotel, he perfected his signature cocktail. Since then, Breakfast Martini has inspired bartenders around the world to create their own cocktails using canned goods such as jam and marmalade. Coincidentally, in Harry Craddock's book «The Savoy Cocktail Book» (1930) edition there is a recipe for a cocktail with marmalade, very similar to Breakfast Martini from Salvatore. However, Maestro says that the inspiration for his drink, which is just a «White Lady» with marmalade, was a hearty English breakfast, not a book source.

Fruit juice was canned with the addition of 15% rum, but in 1867, Lauchlin Rose, the owner of a shipyard in Leith (Scotland), patented a method for preserving fruit juice using sugar rather than alcohol. To make his product more attractive, he packaged the mixture in an attractive bottle and named it «Rose's Lime Cordial». Legend has it that while the privates drank rum, their officers drank gin, so naturally they mixed it with «Rose's» lime cordial. So, the creation of a «Gimlet» is the result of circumstances, not skillful mixing of ingredients, and, frankly, that's exactly how it will taste if you try an uncooled (they didn't have ice) «Gimlet» in a 50-50 ratio. However, stir with ice, bring to a more balanced proportions, and the result will be divine.

Back in the mid-1980s, the Chilean newspaper El Comercio de Iquique reported that the cocktail was created in 1872 by Elliot Stubb, an English steward from the sailing ship Sunshine, who opened a bar in the then Peruvian port of Iquique (now in northern Chile). However, closer examination shows that the quote attributed to Stubb actually referred to whiskey sour, the predecessor of pisco sour, whose origins lead to the United States. An earlier mention of Pisco Sour in the April 22, 1921 issue of the Peruvian magazine Mundial describes the drink as a white drink and attributes its invention to «Mr. Morris»(colon) we are probably talking about Victor Morris, an American who emigrated to Peru in 1901. And the mention in the magazine concerns the 82nd page of the book of visitors to Morri's bar in Lima. The above has long been considered the generally accepted origin of Pisco Sour. This was until February 22, 2012, when the Peruvian writer Raúl Rivera Escobar uploaded a scan of a brochure published in Lima in 1903. Among the recipes, entitled «The New guide to cooking Creole dishes» («Nuevo Manual de Cocina a la Criolla»), on page 32 there is a recipe with the simple name "Cocktail", containing <i>«egg white, a cup of pisco, a teaspoon of sugar and a few drops of lime juice to taste»</i>. Obviously, this is a Pisco Sour, which makes the document the earliest surviving source with a cocktail recipe.

Back in the mid-1980s, the Chilean newspaper El Comercio de Iquique reported that the cocktail was created in 1872 by Elliot Stubb, an English steward from the sailing ship Sunshine, who opened a bar in the then Peruvian port of Iquique (now in northern Chile). However, closer examination shows that the quote attributed to Stubb actually referred to whiskey sour, the predecessor of pisco sour, whose origins lead to the United States. An earlier mention of Pisco Sour in the April 22, 1921 issue of the Peruvian magazine Mundial describes the drink as a white drink and attributes its invention to «Mr. Morris»(colon) we are probably talking about Victor Morris, an American who emigrated to Peru in 1901. And the mention in the magazine concerns the 82nd page of the book of visitors to Morri's bar in Lima. The above has long been considered the generally accepted origin of Pisco Sour. This was until February 22, 2012, when the Peruvian writer Raúl Rivera Escobar uploaded a scan of a brochure published in Lima in 1903. Among the recipes, entitled «The New guide to cooking Creole dishes» («Nuevo Manual de Cocina a la Criolla»), on page 32 there is a recipe with the simple name "Cocktail", containing <i>«egg white, a cup of pisco, a teaspoon of sugar and a few drops of lime juice to taste»</i>.

Peter was a gay man who designed stores and married Hamish Bowles, the editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine. They rented a very nice apartment in Knightsbridge in Kensington and wanted to have a cocktail party, but they didn't have enough money. So I suggested to them the idea that everyone should bring a bottle of sparkling wine. So if you brought trash, you got a trash drink, and if you brought a quality drink, you would drink a quality drink. I filled the bar with glasses, and in each glass there was a glass of vodka, half a glass of lemon juice, two tablespoons of sugar, one tablespoon of currants and ice.

The story of creation can be interpreted in several styles, but it is best described by a quote from Dick (colon). <i>«I created this drink for our friends, Rebecca du Pont de Bie and Peter Kent, in the 80s. Peter was a gay man who designed stores and married Hamish Bowles, the editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine. They rented a very nice apartment in Knightsbridge in Kensington and wanted to have a cocktail party, but they didn't have enough money. So I suggested to them the idea that everyone should bring a bottle of sparkling wine. So if you brought trash, you got a trash drink, and if you brought a quality drink, you would drink a quality drink. I filled the bar with glasses, and in each glass there was a glass of vodka, half a glass of lemon juice, two tablespoons of sugar, one tablespoon of currants and ice. People drank the whole bottle of champagne and as many glasses of vodka as they thought they could afford. This thing was deadly (colon) we had people falling down the stairs and dancing around in wild abandon. «Russian Russian Spring Punch», I called it, because it has vodka that was Russian, and it's «fizz», which is a fresh drink.»</i>
Rusty Nail:<pre>RUSTY NAIL</pre>:cocktails/rusty_nail.jpg:<b>Recipe</b>--- 4.5 cl blended scotch whisky;--- 2.5 cl Drambuie liqueur:<b>Method</b>--- build:<b>Serve in a</b>--- chilled old-fashioned glass with large 2x2-inch ice cube:<b>Garnish</b>--- lemon zest:<em>Note--- serve with no drinking straws</em>:Country of origin ━ 🇺🇸:Created in 1942 in a Hawaiian bar for the artist Theodore Anderson, but popularized in the 1950s at Club 21 in New York. David Wondrich traced the process of mixing Scotch whiskey and Drambuie liqueur since 1937 and created a drink called B.I.F. However, given that Drambuie appeared in an Edinburgh cellar in 1908, we suspect that this combination was first tried decades earlier.

The cocktail has become the main specialty of the bar. Legend has it (colon) because of the phylloxera epidemic that hit grape stocks for cognac production in the 1870s, the main ingredient was replaced with rye whiskey. As bourbon began to dominate American whiskey, many bartenders began to make Sazerac from bourbon rather than rye. The truth, apparently, is that Sazerac has always been a whiskey cocktail - indeed, it was originally known loosely as the «Superior Whiskey Cocktail». Now we have returned to the original recipe.

This is partially confirmed by the following reference to the drink in the October 24, 1949 issue of Time magazine (colon). <i>«In the dimly lit bar of a chic Park Hotel, Turkish intelligence agents chat with American engineers and Balkan refugees while drinking the latest American vodka and orange juice blend called Screwdriver.»</i>

He named the cocktail after two reasons, in his opinion, that prompted tourists to visit Florida on spring break - «sex» and «the beach». «Sex» is associated with the color red (for example, with the red light district) and is represented in this drink in the form of vodka and cranberry moss. These «sexy» ingredients are located on a yellow sandy «beach» consisting of peach schnapps and orange juice.

In his book «The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks» (1948) David A. Embury talks about the origin of the cocktail (colon) (break)<i>«It was invented by a friend of mine in a bar in Paris during the First World War and was named after the motorcycle sidecar in which the good captain used to drive to and from the small bistro where the restaurant was located.

And on page 40 of his 1928 book «When it's Cocktail Time in Cuba" Basil Woon talks about this drink (colon). <i>«This is the aristocrat of cocktails, and it is preferred by upper-class Cubans.»</i>

The cocktail made its way through the disco era of the 70s before its popularity waned in the 1980s, only to escape and become more popular than ever after it became the favorite drink of «The Dude» in the cult 1998 film «The Big Lebowski».

The taste of dry biscuits and citrus fruits inherent in a good champagne brut is an integral part of this cocktail. Vintage may be a bit cloying, but prosecco won't do. Tilt the glass at a slight angle and pour the chilled champagne over the inside of the glass before straightening the glass to complete the pouring so that as little foam as possible is formed. Bubbles will constantly form in the cube, so when properly poured champagne, carbon dioxide will linger in the drink and add a cocktail of pleasant sensations from consumption.:<b>Serve in a</b>--- chilled flute glass with no ice added (optional - champagne coupe):<b>Garnish</b>--- twist of lemon or orange zest:<em>Note. - serve with no drinking straws.</em>:Country of origin ━ 🇮🇹:The first written mention of the cocktail is dated 1855 in the book «Panama in 1855. An Account of the Panama Railroad, of the cities of Panama and Aspinwall with sketches of life and characters on the Isthmus by Robert Tomes» (Harper & Brothers) on pages 61 and 62. It is also found on the pages of Jerry Thomas's book «How to Mix Drinks, or The Bon Vivant's Companion» of both editions (1862 and 1887).
